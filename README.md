# ImHex Pattern for TIFF Files
This repository contains a custom pattern for the ImHex Hex Editor, specifically designed to map the binary structure of TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files according to the TIFF 6.0 specification.

## About the Pattern
The pattern we've developed is based on the TIFF 6.0 specification, which can be found [here](https://developer.adobe.com/content/dam/udp/en/open/standards/tiff/TIFF6.pdf). This specification provides a detailed description of the TIFF file format, which is widely used for storing raster graphics images.

Our pattern allows users of the ImHex Hex Editor to easily decode and analyze the binary structure of TIFF files, providing a valuable tool for anyone working with this file format. This pattern has been incorporated into the official ImHex repository, making it readily available for the ImHex user community.

## Usage
To use this pattern, simply download the .hexpat file from this repository and load it into ImHex. Once loaded, you can use it to analyze any TIFF file.
